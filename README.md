## Project Promise

When Mark and Catie first started the web version of ChatSpace, the promise was simple: provide something people could download and install on even a cheap web host. If a host can run common PHP apps like WordPress or 4images, it should be in the right neighborhood for ChatSpace Community Edition.

That promise is being kept here.

## Authors
